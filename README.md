A keylogger is a type of software or hardware device that records every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device. It essentially keeps track of every key that is pressed, including letters, numbers, symbols, and special keys like Enter and Backspace.

The primary purpose of a keylogger is to secretly capture and record the keystrokes made by a user. This captured data can include passwords, credit card numbers, personal messages, and other sensitive information entered by the user.

Keyloggers can be used for various purposes, both legitimate and malicious. Legitimate uses include monitoring computer activity for parental control or employee monitoring, debugging software, or recovering lost data. However, keyloggers can also be used for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information, spying on users, or gaining unauthorized access to systems and accounts.

It's important to note that using keyloggers without the explicit consent of the user is unethical and illegal in many jurisdictions. Keyloggers can pose significant privacy and security risks if used improperly or without proper authorization. Therefore, it's essential to use keyloggers responsibly and ethically, and only for lawful purposes with the consent of the individuals being monitored.
